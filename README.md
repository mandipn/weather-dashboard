# Weather Dashboard by Mandip Nijor

## Repository

This is a simple weather application which allows a user to view the current and 5 day weather forecast for a chosen city. This app runs in the browser and includes a HTML file, CSS file and a JavaScript file.

## Description

This is a simple weather application which allows a user to view the current and 5 day weather forecast for a chosen city. It also utilises bootstrap and openweathermap API. 

## Instructions

1. When the app loads, type the name of a city in the search box in the top left and press enter or click on the search button.

2. Then you will see the current weather (temperature, wind speed and humidity) for that city at the top towards the middle of the page, and the 5 day forecast towards the bottom.

3. You can then carry on checking the weather for other cities using the same steps as above.

4. If you want to view the weather again for a city you have already viewed the weather for, you can simply select the city from the history list under the search box.

5. You can also clear the search history by clicking on the "Clear History" button.
